<p>CQ stands for curiosity quotient and concerns having a hungry mind.
   People with higher CQ are more inquisitive and open to new experiences.
   They find novelty exciting and are quickly bored with routine.
   They tend to generate many original ideas and are counter-conformist.
   It has not been as deeply studied as EQ and IQ, but there’s some evidence to suggest it is just as important when it comes to managing complexity in two major ways.
   First, individuals with higher CQ are generally more tolerant of ambiguity.
   This nuanced, sophisticated, subtle thinking style defines the very essence of complexity.
   Second, CQ leads to higher levels of intellectual investment and knowledge acquisition over time, especially in formal domains of education, such as science and art (note: this is of course different from IQ’s measurement of raw intellectual horsepower).
   Knowledge and expertise, much like experience, translate complex situations into familiar ones, so CQ is the ultimate tool to produce simple solutions for complex problems.
