<p>
If you are Java developer, you might have used Log4j (Log 4 Java) directly or indirectly in your projects. Ceki Gulcu is the founder of log4j and currently working on a successor called logback. 
</p>

<p>
He did his masters in Telecommunications at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne) - one of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Ceki was admired by colleagues on his commitment to code cleanliness, to quality, and to excellency. 
</p>

<p>
Someone mentioned that Ceki always been a very creative and innovating character. He's technical knowledge reaches far beyong the subject of his work, allowing him to have a very broad problem solving approach. Sadly, only 10 people approved his Log4j skills in LinkedIn (which is very low in our skills research on LinkedIn) 
</p>

<p>
With Log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application bnay. The Log4j package is designed so that these statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a heavy performance cost. 
</p>

<p>
Logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file, without touching the application binary.
