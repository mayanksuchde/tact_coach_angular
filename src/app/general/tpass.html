Our Predictor algorithm will send you 2-4 matched developers weekly who match your "company model"
You can reply one line for each developer prediction if you don't like the developer. Our algorithm will change the model and predict better every week.
If you like the developer, you can conduct one or more interviews with them. They will prove their skills with a clear project (no resume policy)
